  The Center for Transformational Play (CTP) is a research center launched by 
  the Carnegie Mellon University School of Computer Science to house the 
  research and development of transformational games. The CTP serves as the 
  academic intersection of some of CMU’s greatest movers, shakers and positive 
  changers; a hub for game development and research; and most of all a home-base 
  for people who share a passion for the transformational power of interactive 
  media and games. We aim for our work, to be joyful, effective, and valuable to
  those who engage with it.
